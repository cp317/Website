Naming

Class or Method name: MethodName

vars: camel case (varName)

Method names have to be descriptive. i.e Don't name a method that creates a beacon "Banana". Use CreateBeacon

Commenting:

- Have a block on top of a method which describes what the method does.
- If necessary, include comments on the side of code that can describe what the call is doing.

i.e.
/* 
   A detailed description about what the method does
   params: @var1 @var2
   returns: @var3
   Date Updated: DD/MM/YYYY
*/
