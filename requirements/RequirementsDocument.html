	<h2><span id="1.0">1. Introduction</span></h2>
	Study Group Finder is a web-based application that allows students in any university to post and find study group locations. The purpose of this application is to allow students to find study groups with ease. By doing so, students will be able to help each other achieve their academic goals as well as make new acquaintances.

		<h3><span id="1.1">1.1 Purpose </span></h3>
		This document outlines the requirements of the Study Group Finder application and describes its features. During the creation of the application, everyone involved will refer to this document to understand the requirements as well as use it as the basis for their work.

		<h3><span id="1.2">1.2 Scope</span></h3>
		The software being produced is a website called Study Group Finder. This software will be used by students to search for and message people nearby who are studying or doing homework. The objective is to bring students together so they may more easily achieve their academic goals.

		<h3><span id="1.3">1.3 Document Lexicon</span></h3>
		
			<h4><span id="1.3.1">1.3.1 Definitions</span></h4>
				<u>User</u>: Someone who accesses the website, who we will assume is a student.
				<br>
				<u>Registered User</u>: A user who has created an account and logged in.
				<br>
				<u>Guest User</u>: A user who has not created an account or logged in.
				<br>
				<u>User Profile</u>: A page with personal details about the assumed student.  The profile provides functionality such as beacon invites, messaging, and course lists.
				<br>
				<u>Course</u>: A course taken at a university, often represented by a course code, ex. CP317.
				<br>
				<u>Course Page</u>: A page with user submitted details on the course, such as midterm details. The page will also include a chat, so users can discuss the course with each other. 
				<br>		
				<u>Beacon</u>: A study location and the details of that study group, such as the course code, location, and start time of the study session.
				<br>
				<u>Beacon Description</u>: A user entered description of the Beacon, where they state specifics of the location, such as the room number, arrival and departure time, and what they are/will be working on.
				<br>
				<u>Notifications</u>: A message informing the user that a beacon for a course they're in has been created. 
				<br>
				<u>Tags</u>: A small icon which will appear on the left side of the beacon display. This tag will provide information about a group's location to the user, such as if the location takes place in a computer lab or if the location has a whiteboard.
				<br>
				<u>Beacon Preview</u>: The Beacon as it appears on the map. When a user moves their mouse over the beacon, this icon will give a small preview about the given beacon’s description. For a more detailed description of the location the user may go to the left side of the page.
				<br>
				<u>Arrival Time</u>: The time the Beacon creator will arrive at the study location.
				<br>
				<u>Departure Time</u>: The time the Beacon creator will leave the study location.
				<br>

				<u>SRS</u>: Software Requirements Specifications. This is the document which has all requirements and standards contained.
				<br>
				<u>GUI</u>: Graphical User Interface. This is the interface which the user will interact with. It consists of traditional buttons and bars as well as more unique graphics, such as the map.
		
		<h3><span id="1.4">1.4 References</span></h3>
		This SRS document is based on IEEE Std 830-1998.
	   
		<h3><span id="1.5">1.5 Overview</span></h3>
		The rest of this document contains details on the appearance and functionality of the Study Group Finder program.
	
	<h2><span id="2.0">2. Overall Description</span></h2>
	
		<h3><span id="2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</span></h3>
		Study Group Finder is a web based application with two major components: front end and back end. It will also implement the Leaflet / Google Maps API in order to display a map to the user. It will take input from the user to determine relevant beacons to display to them.

			<h4><span id="2.1.1">2.1.1 User Interfaces</span></h4>
			<p>The main view will have a map taking up the right side of the web application. The left half of it will have three filters at the top, which can be used to sort based on location, school name, and course code. Below that, there will be a scrollable list displaying boxes showing detailed information of all the nearby beacons. These boxes will be ordered by arrival time and will include various details including departure time, room number and users present. There will be a chat box for each beacon, which is initially hidden but can be opened by the user. In the top right of the screen, there will be a button that will bring a window for the user to login or register an account. This window will also include the option for a user to reset their password if they have forgotten it. Notifications and invites will appear in the same fashion as chat boxes. </p>
			<p>Each user will have a profile, which displays information such as the courses they are enrolled in or a brief description about themselves. While the default view has the map on the right side of the screen, the user will be able to change the view to show a list of courses at their school or a list of user profiles of other people in their courses. Clicking a course from the course list will take them to the course page, which will include details about the course and a chat box. Clicking a profile from the user list will take the user to that user's profile. </p>
			
			<h4>Sample GUI</h4>
			<img src="Sample-GUI.png" alt="Sample GUI Image" style="width:1130;height:636;">

		<h3><span id="2.2">2.2 Product Functions</span></h3>
		Every user will have the option to create a group or join a group. When a user creates a group they will specify attributes of the group, such as the course code, where the group will be located, and how long the group will be there.  If a user is registered for the same course, they will receive a notification mentioning that a beacon in that course has opened up. If a user wishes to join a group, they will be able to select a group by looking at a map or by scrolling through a list of nearby beacons. The user will be able to search for nearby groups by location, and filter these groups by the university they attend and the course code/course page of the class they are studying. The user who has created a group can drop a pin on the map and other users can join and go to that location. Users will have the option to register an account and sign in to the website, which will allow them to view and edit their beacons from any device they sign in with. Users will be able to open a chat box for each beacon and post messages to the creator of the beacon and anyone else attending that beacon.  Users will be able to view the user profiles of other users, which will allow them to invite users to their beacon or start a private chat with the user. Users will also be able to view a course page for each course, which will contain user submitted information about the course, and will also include a chat. 
		
		<h3><span id="2.3">2.3 User Characteristics</span></h3>
		The intended audience are post-secondary students with the technical expertise to use a website. High school students could also use this product as well.

		<h3><span id="2.4">2.4 Constraints</span></h3>
		Multiple users must be able to access the website at once. To ensure the website feels responsive, the map of nearby beacons should update within a second whenever a user changes their parameters.

		<h3><span id="2.5">2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</span></h3>
		Users are assumed to have a functioning web-capable device with a browser that is compatible with Leaflet/Google Maps. They are expected to have an internet connection until they enter their parameters and relevant Beacons are displayed. Once they have loaded their nearby Beacons, they should be able to disconnect from the internet and still view them, so they can check a Beacon’s description while they are traveling to it. This application should function on any operating system.

	<h2><span id="3.0">3. Specific Requirements</span></h2>
	
		<h3><span id="3.1">3.1 External Interfaces</span></h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The location entered by the user will both be used as a filter, or if they make their own beacon, will serve as their location. It will find nearby beacons or serve as the location for its own beacon. The user will be able to search for their location using the Leaflet/Google Maps API.</li>
			<li>When a user creates a beacon, they will have the option to enter a description, such as specifying their location and the project they are working on. The length of this string will be limited by what fits comfortably within the GUI. </li>
			<li>During the beacon creation process, a user will need to enter their approximate arrival and departure time. The beacons will be displayed in order of arrival time and will stop being displayed to users after the departure time unless extended by the host. To ensure that the departure time is accurate, users will have the option to delete or edit their beacon after creating one.</li>
			<li>The course code entered by the user serves as a filter to find the relevant beacons.  The course code will have a limit of 8 characters.  The course code filter will work in conjunction with the other filters in order to narrow down the most suitable beacons currently near them.</li>
			<li>The name of a user’s high school/university will be entered by the user to be used as another beacon filter.</li>
			<li>If a user searches for a beacon and none are found, display a message saying none have been found.</li>
			<li>The beacon display boxes along the left side of the web application will include the school name, course code, user entered description, the beacon start/end time, and icons for tags such as whether there is a computer lab, whiteboards, WiFi, etc.</li>
			<li>The screen display must fit the window on any resolution display and adjust automatically if the user resizes the window.</li>
			<li>There will be a chat window in the bottom right of the screen, where the user can communicate with their friends and other users of the site.</li>
			<li>The notification box will be adjacent to the chat windows, and users will be able to see beacons coming up for courses they are registered for.</li>
			<li>The course page will allow users to view details on their course submitted by other users. Some details present will be exam details, sections, and other pertinent information to the course. The course page will also include a chat for people to discuss the course.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><span id="3.2">3.2 Functions</span></h3>
    <ul>
			<li>The system shall ensure that when a user creates a beacon and have not left the location, school name, course code, arrival time, or departure time fields blank.</li>
			<li>If the Leaflet/Google Maps API cannot determine the position of their location, it will not be accepted.</li> 
			<li>The departure time must be after the arrival time, but no more than 12 hours after. If a student is studying for more than 12 hours, they will be able to extend the duration. </li> 
			<li>Any spaces in the course code will be removed to simplify searching. For example, "CP 317" and "CP317" will both be compared as "CP317", and therefore will be matched.</li> 
			<li>A user is only allowed to have one active beacon at a time. If they wish to create a beacon while another still exists, the start time of the new beacon must not overlap the duration of any of their existing or planned beacons.</li>
			<li>Once the application receives acceptable input, the data will be stored in the beacon database.</li>
			<li>Clicking the login button will give the user the option to log in, register an account, or reset their password if they have forgotten it</li>
			<li>If a registered user creates a beacon while signed in, they are able to edit or delete this beacon from any device where they sign in</li>
			<li>When a user attempts to register their account, their email address must be of an acceptable format, specifically “*@*.*”, where “*” is a wildcard for a varying amount of characters. The two passwords they enter must be identical, or a message will be displayed saying they are not. Until they have entered a valid email address and the two password fields are identical, they will not be able to create an account.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><span id="3.3">3.3 Logical Database Requirements</span></h3>
		<p>The <b>user</b> table will include exactly one row for each user. Each user will have their own distinct primary key, referred to as the user key. The other columns in this table will include the user’s email address and encrypted password. </p>
		
		<p>The <b>course</b> table will include exactly one row for each course, and will contain the course code and user-entered details about the course. The course code will be the primary key, and it will also include a chat key from the <b>chat</b> table, so that the course page can retrieve the chat messages associated with the course page.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>beacon</b> table will include exactly one row for each beacon, and a unique primary key for each beacon. It will include the longitude and latitude of the study group, their school, course code, arrival time, and departure time. It will also include boolean columns for various tags, such as whether or not there is a computer lab, whiteboards, WiFi, etc. It will also include the user key from the <b>user</b> table as a foreign key, which will allow beacons to be mapped to the user who created them. it will also include a chat key from the <b>chat</b> table, so the beacon page can retrieve the chat messages associated with the beacon. The <b>beacon</b> table will be accessed every 5-15 minutes to refresh the list of nearby beacons. The <b>beacon</b> table will need to be updated every time a user creates a new beacon.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>chat</b> table will include one row for every chat message sent. The primary key will be a chat key, which will refer to either the beacon, course page, or private discussion where the chat occurs. Specifically, each beacon, course page, or private discussion will have exactly one unique chat key, which will be associated with every message in that chat. The <b>chat</b> table will also include a string containing the text of the message, the time the message was sent, and the user key of the user who sent the message as a foreign key from the <b>user</b> table. </p>

		<h3><span id="3.4">3.4 Portability</span></h3>
		We must create the application to be accessible on all devices, both mobile and desktop. This means it must be able to be accessed on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux devices. There is no mobile version of the web site. Because of the application’s web based nature, it is also necessary to make it work flawlessly on all browsers which are most commonly used, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer (version 8.0+). 
	
	<h2><span id="4.0">4. Optional Features</span></h2>
	The basic functions that our application must include are outlined in Section 2.2. In addition to those features, there are other functions we hope to include. However, due to time constraints, these functions may not be included in the final product. Listed below are these additional features:
	<ul>
		<li>Getting user profile icons using their email address</li>
		<li>Intelligent correction of user mistakes when inputting school name</li>
		<li>Favourite locations</li>
		<li>Quiet/busy areas on map</li>
		<li>Suggested locations to users</li>
		<li>Search for multiple courses at once (separated by comma, semicolon, etc.)</li>
		<li>Automatically open at user’s location / automatically move to school’s location</li>
	</ul>
