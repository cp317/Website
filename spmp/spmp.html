		Study Space is a web-based application that allows students in any university to post and find study group locations. The purpose of this application is to allow students to find study groups with ease. By doing so, students help each other achieve their academic goals as well as make new acquaintances.

			<span id="3.0">Managerial Process</span>
		</h2>
		
		<h3>
			<span id="3.1">Management Objectives and Priorities</span>
		</h3>
		The primary goal of this project is to create a web application that people use to find study locations for certain courses. This project should be completed before August 9, 2017. The budget is no concern, as there is no budget to go over.
		
		<h3>
			<span id="3.2">Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints</span>
		</h3>
		The assumption being made for this project is that the application is being used in an environment where internet is readily available. This project is dependent on the knowledge of members, as certain technologies may require members to learn how to use it. The constraints for this project is the time available and the limited funds.
	
		<h3>
			<span id="3.3">Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</span>
		</h3>
		This project will be monitored and controlled by having teams perform software quality assurance on all section of the project, having a shared GitHub repository, and a manager to keep groups on schedule.
	
		<h2>
			<span id="4.0">Technical Process</span>
		</h2>
		
		<h3>
			<span id="4.1">Methods, Tools, and Techniques</span>
		</h3>
